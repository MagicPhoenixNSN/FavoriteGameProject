                        <p> Core Keeper can be played with up to 6 freinds all online at once. There are many things to explore and find with your freinds, along with over 6+ bosses you can fight together. Work together to mine resources, fight, farm, craft and survive. It's like combining Terraria and Minecaft, then adding a pixel art and a top down perspective.</p>
