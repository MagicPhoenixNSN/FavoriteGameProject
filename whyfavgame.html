                        <p> I love core keeper. I love top down games, and the idea of being able to automate everything. I really enjoy trying to push the automation to it's limits. I don't enjoy deafeating bosses as much, but their are even ways to automate that. I love the differnt play styles you can play too; from tank to ranged to melee.</p>
